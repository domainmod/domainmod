This feature enables you to perform complete backups and restores of your DomainMOD database. This allows you to export your entire system in a single file so that it can easily be backed up and/or restored, which is helpful if you want to perform regular backups of your data, you need to move DomainMOD to a new server, or you want to change your installation method. This process backs up the data saved in your database. If you also want to save your database connection information, you should backup your /_includes/config.inc.php file.

This option uses your domain registrar's API to retrieve information required to add domains, so unfortunately it only works if your registrar has an API and support for it has been built into DomainMOD. Before using this option make sure your API credentials have been saved with your registrar account. Supported Registrars The following registrars are currently supported by the Domain Queue: Above.com, Cloudflare, DNSimple, DreamHost, Dynadot, eNom, Fabulous, Freenom (Reseller Accounts Only), Gandi, GoDaddy, Internet.bs, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, OpenSRS, Porkbun, ResellerClub Usage Requirement In order to use the Domain Queue you must first setup the cron job that comes with DomainMOD. Click on Domains on the main menu. Click the Add Domains To Queue button on the Domains page. On the dropdown list, choose the registrar account that you would like to import using the Domain Queue. If requested, paste in a list of the domains you want to add to the Domain Queue. This is not always required, as some domain registrars will retrieve the list of domains from your account automatically. Click the Add Domains button.

You can also access the Domain Queue by clicking on Queue on the main menu (this menu option is only available when you have domains being processed in the queue).

API Notes This section contains various notes and things to watch out for when using the domain registrar APIs. DreamHost DreamHost does not currently allow the WHOIS privacy status of a domain to be retrieved via their API, so all domains added to the Domain Queue from a DreamHost account will have their WHOIS privacy status set to No by default. Freenom Freenom currently only gives API access to reseller accounts. Gandi Gandi does not currently allow the WHOIS privacy status of a domain to be retrieved via their API, so all domains added to the Domain Queue from a Gandi account will have their WHOIS privacy status set to No by default. GoDaddy When retrieving your list of domains from GoDaddy, the current limit is 1,000 domains. If you have more than this you should export the full list of domains from GoDaddy and paste it into the Domains to add field when adding domains via the Domain Queue. NameSilo NameSilo's domains have 6 possible statuses: Active, Expired (grace period), Expired (restore period), Expired (pending delete), Inactive, and Pending Outbound Transfer When retrieving your list of domains via the API, Inactive domains are not returned. When retrieving the details of a specific domain via the API, Inactive and Expired (pending delete) domains will not return any data. Porkbun When retrieving your list of domains from Porkbun, the current limit is 1,000 domains. If you have more than this you should export the full list of domains from Porkbun and paste it into the Domains to add field when adding domains via the Domain Queue.

For security reasons DomainMOD only supports the MySQLi extension. If you're receiving messages that the MySQLi extension is unavailable in PHP you will need to install and enable it on your server before you can use DomainMOD. Note As of v4.07, DomainMOD uses the PDO extension instead of the MySQLi extension. Configuration Can I import my domains into DomainMOD using a CSV file? Not currently, but this is something that we're investigating for the future. If your domain registrar has an API, and it's supported by DomainMOD , you can use the Domain Queue to automatically import your domains. Does DomainMOD support multiple languages? Yes! As of v4.16.0 DomainMOD supports Dutch, English (Canada), English (United States), French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. If you speak one of these languages, you will probably be horrified at the quality of the current translations. This is because an automated translation service was used for this, but I hope the quality of the translations will improve greatly over time. If you would like to help improve the translations, feel free to head over to our translations page on GitHub . Which domain registrar APIs does DomainMOD currently support? DomainMOD currently supports Above.com, DNSimple, DreamHost, Dynadot, eNom, Fabulous, Freenom (Reseller Accounts Only), Gandi, GoDaddy, Internet.bs, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, OpenSRS, Porkbun, and ResellerClub. Usage How many domains can I manage with DomainMOD? Theoretically there's no limit on the number of domains you can manage, it just depends on your server hardware and the settings chosen in DomainMOD. The default settings can handle thousands of domains, and over 10,000 depending on how much information you've chosen to display on the front page, but if things start slowing down you can enable large mode to speed things up. Large mode uses a different method for displaying the information on the main domain page, and although it doesn't offer as many of the advanced features as the default settings, it allows you to manage a lot more domains. Can I use DomainMOD to sell domains? The primary use for DomainMOD is to manage a large portfolio of domains, and it currently doesn't have any sales features, such as being able to host sales letter landing pages. This is something we're looking at implementing in a future version of DomainMOD. If all you want to do is track the amount you sold a domain for, you can create a Custom Field, which will allow you to record the sales amount for your domains. I don't need to keep track of the fees associated with my domains. Can I disable this feature? There's currently no way to disable fees, as the system requires them in order to link the database tables, but if you don't care about keeping track of the fees you can just enter zeros for all of the costs. I noticed you can set the registration, transfer, and renewal prices for domains via their domain registrars, but can you set a purchase price for a specific domain? For example, if I purchase a domain from a 3rd party marketplace can I record this information in DomainMOD? Although this is not a standard field, you can use Custom Fields to keep track of the purchase price of your domains. Is it possible to display the custom fields I've created on the main domain page as a column? This is something we're still investigating, as we realize how helpful this feature would be for some people, however if it happens it's probably going to be a while still. Although on the surface it seems like it may be pretty easy to implement, there's actually quite a bit to it and it's going to take quite a bit of work. Also, since you can accomplish pretty much the same thing by exporting your domain list and sorting the exported data in something like excel (since it includes all of your custom fields), implementing this within the UI is not very high on the priority list. Note As of v4.13, you can now display your Custom Fields on the main domain page. Are the domain expiration dates updated automatically using the domain's WHOIS information? No, expiration dates currently need to be updated manually when the domains are renewed. Expiration dates can be updated one-by-one or by using the Bulk Updater . Do you plan to add API support for domain registries? For API imports we've been trying to focus on actual registrars, since unlike registries they cover more than just one (or a few) domain extensions, and actual registrars are what most domainers use, which is who DomainMOD is primarily for. There are always exceptions to this of course, but in general this is the case. Also, if we were to start adding API import support for registries this would open up a pretty big can of worms, since there are literally hundreds of registries that could be added. If we add one registrar we add support for all of the extensions that registrar has, whereas if we add support for a registry we only add support for a single extension (or in some cases a few extensions). So although registry support may happen at some point, it's not currently very high on the priority list. Is it possible to encrypt the data stored in DomainMOD? It's not currently possible to encrypt the data in the database, however it's something we're hoping to implement in some way in the future. Based on our research it wouldn't be a small task to implement, and unfortunately, all things considered, it's just not one of the top priorities at the moment. Adding encryption would also create quite a few challenges with some features we have planned for the future.

DomainMOD also includes a Data Warehouse framework that allows you to import your web server data so that you can view, export, and report on your live data. Currently the Data Warehouse only supports web servers running WHM/cPanel. Live Demo Not sure if DomainMOD is what you're looking for? Don't want to take the time to install it only to find out that it's not? We hate when that happens ourselves, which is why we've setup a live demo so you don't waste your time. So go ahead, take the live demo for a test drive before you install: https://demo.domainmod.org Requirements Software : PHP 8.1-8.2.9, MariaDB 10.4-11.1.2 or MySQL 5.7-8.1.0 PHP Extensions : PDO (MariaDB/MySQL), cURL, OpenSSL, gettext PHP Settings : allow_url_fopen Downloading There are currently four options for downloading DomainMOD. Option #1 -- Using Docker Please see our official DomainMOD container on Docker Hub for more information: https://hub.docker.com/r/domainmod/domainmod Option #2 -- Downloading a .zip file Visit the following URL to download DomainMOD in a .zip file: https://domainmod.org/download/ Option #3 -- Using Git To download using Git, change to the directory where you want to install DomainMOD and run the following command (this download option requires that you have git installed on your server): git clone https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod.git Option #4 -- Installing via Softaculous Softaculous is the web hosting industry's leading software auto-installer, and it has helped millions of users install applications with a few clicks of a mouse. Softaculous easily integrates into the leading control panels like cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, InterWorx, H-Sphere, and more. Check your hosting control panel or contact your web host if you're not sure if they offer Softaculous. To install DomainMOD simply open Softaculous, use the search feature to find DomainMOD, and then click the \"Install Now\" button. After you answer a few questions about your installation Softaculous will do the rest. More Information: http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/others/DomainMOD/ Installing If you installed DomainMOD using Docker or Softaculous in the previous step you can ignore the rest of this Installing section, as you should already have DomainMOD up-and-running. If you downloaded the .zip file in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your web server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer). If you used Git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you in a folder called /domainmod/. Feel free to rename this folder to whatever you want. Installation Steps Create a MySQL database that will be used to store DomainMOD's data. In the '_includes' folder, copy config.SAMPLE.inc.php to config.inc.php and then update config.inc.php to reflect your web server's settings. In a web browser, visit the URL where you just installed DomainMOD, enter the requested information, and then click the Install button. For example, example.com/domainmod/. After a few seconds a message will appear letting you know that the installation was successful. Setup the below cron job on your web server. Cron Job DomainMOD includes a Task Scheduler that allows you to run various system jobs at specified times, which helps keep your DomainMOD installation up-to-date and running smoothly, as well as notifies you of important information, such as emailing you to let you know about upcoming Domain & SSL Certificate expirations. The Task Scheduler is very powerful, and it enables features that you otherwise wouldn't be able to use, but in order for it to function you need to schedule the below cron job to run on your web server. Once the cron job is setup to run, the Task Scheduler will be live. If you installed DomainMOD using Docker, the cron job will be setup and running automatically within the container, so there's nothing you need to setup manually. Filename: /cron.php Note This file should be executed every 10 minutes. Security Although we've done our best to secure DomainMOD, unfortunately there are many factors that could cause security holes, such as the software being run on insecure hardware, software like PHP and MySQL having out-of-date versions with known vulnerabilities, easy-to-guess passwords being used, and so on. Due to these factors we recommend the following steps to help secure your DomainMOD installation. Secure your installation with an SSL Certificate. Do not use easy-to-guess passwords. Ever . Although DomainMOD has its own authentication system, we recommend that you also use HTTP authentication on your installation directory to add an extra layer of security. Do not store your account passwords or API keys in DomainMOD. Although the ability to save this information exists, use it at your own risk . This information is fairly secure if you run DomainMOD on your local computer, but there's a much higher risk of someone gaining access to it if you host the site on a server that is accessible to the outside world. Warning Saving your API keys (and other relevant API connection information) in DomainMOD is necessary if you want to use the Domain Queue, however we recommend that you only save this information temporarily while you're using the Domain Queue, and that you remove it as soon as you're done. Do not host DomainMOD on a public website or on an easy-to-guess URL. If you do end up hosting DomainMOD on a public website, you should use your website's robots.txt file to block bots and spiders from crawling your site, otherwise your DomainMOD URL may end up in public search results. Do not give the URL to anyone who does not need to access DomainMOD. You should treat the URL like a password. Always use the most up-to-date version of DomainMOD. This will help protect you from any security vulnerabilities that are found and fixed. First Run After you've installed DomainMOD you should go through the First Run section to finish getting the software ready to use.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#about","text":"DomainMOD is an open source application written in PHP & MySQL used to manage your domains and other internet assets in a central location.

If you downloaded the .zip file in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your web server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer). If you used Git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you in a folder called /domainmod/. Feel free to rename this folder to whatever you want. Installation Steps Create a MySQL database that will be used to store DomainMOD's data. In the '_includes' folder, copy config.SAMPLE.inc.php to config.inc.php and then update config.inc.php to reflect your web server's settings. In a web browser, visit the URL where you just installed DomainMOD, enter the requested information, and then click the Install button. For example, example.com/domainmod/.

Due to these factors we recommend the following steps to help secure your DomainMOD installation. Secure your installation with an SSL Certificate. Do not use easy-to-guess passwords. Ever . Although DomainMOD has its own authentication system, we recommend that you also use HTTP authentication on your installation directory to add an extra layer of security. Do not store your account passwords or API keys in DomainMOD. Although the ability to save this information exists, use it at your own risk . This information is fairly secure if you run DomainMOD on your local computer, but there's a much higher risk of someone gaining access to it if you host the site on a server that is accessible to the outside world. Warning Saving your API keys (and other relevant API connection information) in DomainMOD is necessary if you want to use the Domain Queue, however we recommend that you only save this information temporarily while you're using the Domain Queue, and that you remove it as soon as you're done. Do not host DomainMOD on a public website or on an easy-to-guess URL. If you do end up hosting DomainMOD on a public website, you should use your website's robots.txt file to block bots and spiders from crawling your site, otherwise your DomainMOD URL may end up in public search results. Do not give the URL to anyone who does not need to access DomainMOD. You should treat the URL like a password. Always use the most up-to-date version of DomainMOD. This will help protect you from any security vulnerabilities that are found and fixed.","title":"Security"},{"location":"getting-started/#first-run","text":"After you've installed DomainMOD you should go through the First Run section to finish getting the software ready to use.","title":"First Run"},{"location":"migrating/","text":"Warning Before migrating it's strongly recommended that you backup your DomainMOD installation directory and database. If something goes wrong during the migration process there may be no way to recover your data, and having a backup of your installation directory and database will allow you to easily restore your data. The Backup & Restore instructions can be found here . To migrate your DomainMOD installation from one server to another: [Old Server] Upgrade to the newest version of DomainMOD [Old Server] Export a copy of your DomainMOD database using the above Backup feature [New Server] Download and install the newest version of DomainMOD [New Server] Login to DomainMOD and navigate to Administration -> Backup & Restore [New Server] In the Restore section, click the Choose File button and then select the domainmod-backup.sql file that you want to restore [New Server] Click the Restore Entire Database button [New Server] Once the restore is complete you will automatically be logged out of DomainMOD.

In order for DomainMOD to install and run, strict mode must to be disabled. To disable strict mode you need to edit your MySQL configuration file. In it there will be a line that looks like: sql-mode=\"STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\" To disable strict mode you need to remove STRICT_TRANS_TABLES from this line (including the comma after it, if there is one), which in this example would leave you with: sql-mode=\"NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\" Once disabled you will need to restart MySQL, and then DomainMOD should install properly. Note As of v4.11, DomainMOD will try to disable strict mode automatically during the database connection, but if you're still experiencing issues you should follow the steps above. I'm receiving an error that there are too many redirects The images and CSS are broken This is generally caused by an invalid web root in your config.inc.php file. Please double check your config.inc.php file and confirm that the $web_root variable reflects the directory where you installed DomainMOD. For example, if you access DomainMOD via the URL http://example.com/domains/ the $web_root variable should be: $web_root = \"/domains\"; (don't include a trailing slash!) And if you've installed DomainMOD in the root folder of a domain or subdomain, the $web_root variable in your config.inc.php file should be blank, like so: $web_root = \"\"; Upgrading There was an issue while upgrading and now I can't access DomainMOD Although we personally haven't see this happen yet, it's definitely possible. This is why we recommend you backup your DomainMOD installation directory and database before upgrading (you did make that backup, right?). Follow these steps to restore your copy of DomainMOD: Restore your DomainMOD database backup to the same location as your previous DomainMOD database. Instead of logging into DomainMOD to upgrade your database, run the below script from the command line. [FULL SERVER PATH TO DOMAINMOD]/update.php The full command will look something like this, depending on the location of PHP and DomainMOD on your server: /usr/bin/php -f /home/user/www/domainmod/update.php If you receive a notice that your upgrade was successful , switch back to your web browser and try to login to DomainMOD. If you're able to login successfully you can ignore the rest of these steps. If you receive a notice that your upgrade was unsuccessful , keep a record of any error messages that are displayed and proceed to the next step. Restore your DomainMOD database backup again, then download the previous version that you were using and go through the standard installation steps, pointing it at your newly-restored database in the config.inc.php file. This should get you back to where you were before you tried upgrading. Contact us with any error messages that were displayed and we'll try to help figure out what went wrong with your upgrade. Usage The software seems to be working properly, but some messages are being displayed, such as \" undefined index \" and \" undefined variable \" This is related to the error reporting level that you have turned on in PHP. Although these are only warnings and won't actually be breaking anything, you can get rid of them by editing your php.ini file and changing the error_reporting line. Right now you probably have something that looks like this: error_reporting = E_ALL But you should have something that looks like this: error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED Commented out in your php.ini file, above the error_reporting directive, there may be a suggested error reporting line for a \"Production\" environment. Try using that line instead of what you're using now, restart Apache/PHP, and that should get rid of the errors. I'm trying to connect DomainMOD to my domain registrar account using the API so that I can import my domains, but everything in the Domain Queue just says \"Pending\" In order to import your domains using the domain registrar's API you must setup the cron job that comes with DomainMOD. In addition to having the cron job running, you must also have your API credential saved along with your registrar account Asset. I'm trying to import data using the Domain Queue, but everything is stuck on \"Processing\" In case there's an issue with the cron job you can also try triggering the queue manually. Go to Administration -> Task Scheduler , and then beside \"Domain Queue Processing\" click the \"run now\" link (this may take a bit of time to run). Then go back to the queue and see if anything has changed. If that doesn't work you can try clearing the queue items that are currently processing by going to Administration -> Maintenance , and then clicking on \"Clear Queue Processing\". Now try the last suggestion again to see if running the queue manually through the Task Scheduler helps. If that still doesn't do it go to Administration -> Maintenance , and then click on \"Clear Queues\". This will completely clear out the queue. Now try retrieving your data again using the Domain Queue. I've setup the Data Warehouse within DomainMOD, but none of my changes propagate to my web server The Data Warehouse is read-only. You can import data from your web server into your Data Warehouse, but this data is for informational purposes only, and you can't edit your server data within DomainMOD and have it update your web server. This is something that will be worked on in the future, but is currently not possible. I'm getting the error, \"Database Connection Error: 1045\" Error 1045 is an access denied error, which seems to be caused when the user doesn't have appropriate permissions on the database, or there's another privilege issue with the database. Unfortunately this is pretty difficult to troubleshoot on our end, as there are many things that can cause this. We would recommend trying some of the suggestions for this error in Google and see if any of them help: https://www.google.com/search?q=Database+Connection+Error%3A+1045 . Form fields aren't displaying properly, such as checkboxes and text fields showing as empty boxes This is usually caused by JavaScript being disabled in your web browser. If enabling JavaScript doesn't fix the issue try disabling any ad blockers or other content blockers you may have installed. The currency conversions aren't working properly My fees are all showing up as zero This is usually caused by a currency converter that's experiencing downtime. You can fix this by changing the currency conversion source. Click Administration on the main menu, then click System Settings . Click on the Currency Converter dropdown menu and choose a new source. Click the Update System Settings button. After the Currency Converter source has been changed you can force a currency conversion update by going to Maintenance -> Update Conversion Rates . Debugging If you're still having issues you can enable Debugging Mode, which will make DomainMOD start logging your actions and errors, which can help us troubleshoot your issue. Note No sensitive information gets stored in the debugging log. Passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information is replaced with asterisks, so we will never be able to view your private data. To enable Debugging Mode: Click Administration on the main menu, then click System Settings . Change the Debugging Mode option to Enabled . Click the Update System Settings button. Once debugging is enabled use DomainMOD as you normally would, repeating the steps you took when you first encountered the issue. Once you've done this continue with the below steps. If you haven't already, visit the DomainMOD support forum or issue tracker and post about your issue. In DomainMOD, click on Administration and then Debug Log . Click the Export button to export the debugging log. In addition to the debugging log you should also retrieve your PHP error log, which will give us additional information about your issue. To find the location of your PHP error log: In DomainMOD, click on Administration and then System Information . Look for the heading named PHP Error Log Location . This will show you the location of the PHP error log on your web server. Once you have both your debugging log and PHP error log send an email to debugging@domainmod.org and attach the log files. Please also include the URL to your support forum post or issue tracker ticket so that we can determine the issue you're contacting us about. We will review your logs and get back to you as soon as we can! Also, if you haven't already, make sure you disable Debugging Mode. Helper Programs If all else fails, DomainMOD has some \"helper\" programs that support can supply you with in order to help investigate or fix your issue. Helper programs are nothing more than simple scripts that can perform actions on your DomainMOD installation, whether it's performing an update on your database or setting a temporary variable. Although helpers are generally custom and specific to the user's issue, we wanted to include a generic helper publicly so that users could get a feel for what helpers are and what they do. In DomainMOD v4.18, we implemented strict Content Security Policy headers in order to help secure the application and reduce the risk of certain web-based attacks. We also enabled forced HTTPS, which ensures that your DomainMOD installation will only work if you've secured your web hosting with an SSL certificate. Although we highly recommend keeping the CSP headers enabled, as well as using an SSL certificate to secure your DomainMOD installation, we realize that some users may not always be able to have these features enabled. If you're one of those users, and you need to disable CSP and HTTPS, you could use the below helper to do so. You would simply create the file /helpers/top.php and paste the below contents into it. That's all there is to it! The next time your visit your DomainMOD installation CSP and forced HTTPS will both be disabled. <?php // Contents of: /helpers/top.php $disable_csp = 1; $force_https = 0; Warning If you're using a helper to investigate or fix something, and the helper is only intended to be used temporarily, don't forget to delete the helper file as soon as you're done using it!","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#upgrading","text":"","title":"Upgrading"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#debugging","text":"If you're still having issues you can enable Debugging Mode, which will make DomainMOD start logging your actions and errors, which can help us troubleshoot your issue.
